## ISSUSE 15 : move git functionality into src/github modules

Refactored the GitHub/Git functionality by creating a new src/github/ folder and splitting the monolithic git.js into 4 modular files: auth.js (authentication checks), commands.js (individual git operations like init, add, commit, push), gitignore.js (.gitignore setup), and index.js (main orchestrator that exports everything). Updated the imports in src/index.js to point to the new ./github path and deleted the old git.js. The flow remains unchanged - initGit() works exactly the same way, but the code is now cleaner and more maintainable.
